Spirit of Half-Life version 1.2
Source code release 20/11/03

(wow, should I be scared that the last source release was almost a
year ago?)

Basically, this is Spirit 1.0, ported to the HLSDK version 2.3 by
Codiac.
There are a couple of Dark Truths features, including the Aurora
particle system, here - along with a few minor bug fixes both by
Gollum and me.
