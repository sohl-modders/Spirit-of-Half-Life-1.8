Additional files that you will need in order to play and/or map SoHL 1.5a4 - but you may already have them. In fact you might even have newer versions - in which case you won't want to overwrite them with these - which is why they're included here instead of where they actually should go. 

The Spirit.fgd file is updated for Spirit 1.5a4, and includes stuff not in the earlier fgd for Spirit. It includes support for models in Hammer3.5 . Put it with your fgd files.

The cg.dll and cgGL.dll files are for CG shader support. If you already have them, only use these it they're newer. Put them in your Half-Life folder (NOT the Spirit of Half-Life folder!).

The hw.dll and sw.dll files support model transparency, and are the same ones that were introduced for Day of Defeat. Only use these if they're newer than the ones you already have, or if you're seeing models in game that have blue or black in places that look like they ought to be transparent. Put them in your Half-Life folder (NOT the Spirit of Half-Life folder!). 

The ZHLT folder contains a copy of Zoner's Half-Life Tools, version 3.4 (32bit). You'll need them for the switchable texture lights available in Spirit. Put them wherever you have your compile tools. These are only needed if you intend to map for Spirit.
